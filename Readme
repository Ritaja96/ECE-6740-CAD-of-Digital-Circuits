Efficient and effective digital circuit design and testing require identifying the smallest set of rectification targets within the circuit. This process is critical as it can optimize the performance, scalability, and reliability of the final product. By minimizing the number of internal nets that require testing and rectification, designers can improve the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the design process. Additionally, ensuring that all outputs are tested and rectified can significantly enhance the circuit design’s reliability and quality by reducing the risk of errors and failures. Our objective here is to find the smallest set of internal nets that can be chosen as rectification targets, in order to ensure that all the buggy outputs can be reached and tested for correctness. In other words, the objective of this report is to find the minimum number of internal nets N required such that every buggy output Z is in the transitive fanout of some ni ∈ N.
